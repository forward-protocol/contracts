- create forward bids (single-token or token-list)
- once bid is accepted
  -> keep track of the price the token sold at (unit price for ERC1155)
  -> move token to global vault (assigning proper internal ownership)
- once in the global vault
  -> can list on opensea via seaport (ensure the paid royalties are within X% of the token entry price)
  -> can list internally (ownership changes within the vault)
